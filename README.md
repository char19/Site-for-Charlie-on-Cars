# Site-for-Charlie-on-Cars
This is Charlie's site about his favourite cars. He deserves it becasue he's an awesome students!

The site.html file contains all the content of the website. This gets edited the most.
The "css" files hold all the instruction on how content looks -- this includes the colours or some objects, the size of the fonts, and the layout of the pictures.
The "js" files hold code to do some cool programs -- we never learned much about this yet.
